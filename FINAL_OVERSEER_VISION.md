## Playground & Eye Testing

The updated playground delivers a full local-first diagnostic surface for Overseer flows and individual Eye runs.

- **Dual Modes**  
  - *Overseer Pipeline*: the primary form submits a task to `POST /api/mcp/run`, passes the active strictness profile, and streams the full dynamic pipeline.  
  - *Eye Test Panel*: a second form targets `POST /api/eyes/:eyeId/test`, allowing direct execution of a single Eye with ad‑hoc input. Responses surface the raw envelope, alongside a prettified summary card.

- **Session Cohesion**  
  - Every playground session reuses the global session selector. Selecting a session updates the URL query string (`/monitor?sessionId=…`) so the monitor view opens in sync.  
  - Sessions created on demand use the slug pattern `<tool>-<agent>-NN` (for example `third_eye_overseer-claude-desktop-04`), matching the naming logic in `SessionManager`.

- **Local-First UX**  
  - Endpoints intentionally remain unauthenticated—mirroring the desktop, single-user environment the product targets.  
  - Results cache in the existing session timeline, giving immediate parity with the monitor view and keeping all Eye outputs in one place.

- **Strictness Awareness**  
  - The strictness slider writes 0–100 values consistently (UI, docs, DB seed, auto-router), so every test run honors the same thresholds.


## Model Duel Mode

Duel mode now offers a model-agnostic comparison harness fully driven by backend data.

- **Dynamic Provider Catalogue**  
  - The UI fetches `/api/models` to populate supported providers/models (Groq, Ollama, LM Studio). No more hardcoded competitors.  
  - Model refreshes surface provider authentication errors with explicit 401 responses, helping diagnose key issues quickly.

- **Flexible Competitors**  
  - Users can stage 2–4 configurations, each with provider + model selection. The POST body to `/api/duel` (and `/api/duel/v2`) passes these configs, which the backend feeds into `EyeOrchestrator.runEye` via provider overrides.

- **Rich Telemetry**  
  - Duel results include provider labels, model names, latency, token usage, verdicts, and a composite score, making side-by-side evaluation actionable.  
  - Pipeline events and duel result cards mirror the provider metadata so the monitor, duel dashboard, and stored history stay in sync.

- **Graceful Defaults**  
  - Legacy identifiers (e.g., `groq:llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) continue to work through parsing helpers that map providers/models sensibly.  
  - Errors remain local-friendly—no external tooling or auth layers block experimentation.

## Quality Signals

- Automated suites run through `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:coverage` (Vitest) and `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright). Coverage spans MCP tool discovery, strictness/context propagation, envelope validation, duel scoring, and UI smoke paths.
- Manual validation through the playground, monitor (including kill switch + reruns), and duel UI confirms session synchronisation, preset alignment, provider/model overrides, and clear error surfacing for provider authentication misconfiguration.

## Executive Summary

Third Eye MCP is **NOT** a content generator or validator that agents submit work to. It is an **intelligent overseer system** that empowers AI agents with "inner perception" - the ability to understand what humans really mean before creating content, and verify their work meets human intent after creation.

### The Vision in Three Sentences

1. **Human sees magic**: User talks to AI agent naturally, agent asks smart clarifying questions and delivers better results - user never knows Third Eye exists
2. **Agent gets superpowers**: Agent silently consults Third Eye for guidance before creating, and validation after creating - seamless integration via MCP protocol  
3. **Developer watches live**: Real-time web portal shows the agent's complete "thought process" as a conversation between Eyes - like watching the agent think

### What Makes This Revolutionary

- ✅ **LLM-Powered Routing**: Overseer LLM analyzes each request and dynamically decides which Eyes to use (not hardcoded!)
- ✅ **Two-Phase Operation**: Eyes provide GUIDANCE before agent creates, and VALIDATION after - not just rejection
- ✅ **Completely Invisible**: Human experience is seamless - just a smarter AI agent
- ✅ **Fully Observable**: Developers see real-time conversation log with colored speakers and technical data
- ✅ **No Rejections**: System guides and validates, never rejects - always helps agent improve

---

## Core Vision & Philosophy

### What Third Eye Really Is

**NOT:**
- ❌ A linear validation pipeline that every request goes through
- ❌ A content generator that creates work for agents
- ❌ A rigid rule-based system with hardcoded logic
- ❌ A visible tool that humans interact with directly
- ❌ A blocker or rejection machine

**IS:**
- ✅ An intelligent overseer that empowers AI agents with inner perception
- ✅ A dynamic routing system where Overseer LLM decides the validation flow
- ✅ Completely invisible to human users (seamless agent experience)
- ✅ Fully observable via web portal (exciting real-time conversation log)
- ✅ A guidance + validation system that improves agent output quality
- ✅ An extensible architecture that adapts to any request type

### The Core Philosophy

> **"Third Eye gives AI agents the ability to see what humans really mean, BEFORE they create, and verify what they've created meets human intent, AFTER creation."**

**Three Fundamental Principles:**

#### 1. Invisible Empowerment
- Human talks to agent naturally
- Agent consults Third Eye silently in background  
- Human sees better results, not the machinery
- **Example**: User asks for "palm care report", agent asks clarifying questions (guided by Sharingan), user thinks agent is just being thorough

#### 2. LLM Intelligence Over Rules
- No hardcoded pipeline logic
- Overseer LLM analyzes each request
- Decides optimal validation route dynamically
- **Example**: "Review this code" → Mangekyo only. "Generate report" → Full text pipeline

#### 3. Guidance + Validation (Two Phases)
- **GUIDANCE Phase**: Before agent creates content
  - Eyes provide criteria, ask questions, refine requirements
  - Agent uses this guidance to create better content
- **VALIDATION Phase**: After agent creates content
  - Eyes verify against criteria, check quality
  - Agent iterates based on feedback

## Key Realizations

### Realization 1: DYNAMIC PIPELINE - Not Linear!

**❌ WRONG (Initial Understanding):**
```
Every request → Overseer → Sharingan → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Rinnegan → Mangekyo → Tenseigan → Byakugan
```

**✅ CORRECT (The Vision):**

Overseer is the **INTELLIGENT ROUTER** that decides the pipeline based on request analysis:

| Request Example | Pipeline Route | Reasoning |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| "Generate a report" | Sharingan → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Tenseigan → Byakugan | Text content needs ambiguity check, refinement, intent confirmation, fact validation, and final approval |
| "Review this code" | Mangekyo only | Already have content, skip guidance Eyes, go straight to code review |
| "Is this claim accurate?" | Tenseigan only | Single validation task - just fact-checking needed |
| "Plan this feature" | Sharingan → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Rinnegan | Planning task - needs clarity, refinement, intent, then plan review (not code) |
| "Here's my draft code + tests" | Mangekyo → Tenseigan | Code validation + any factual claims check |

**Key Insight**: Overseer LLM decides on the fly - no rigid patterns!

### Realization 2: Mode Detection by Overseer LLM

The Overseer persona includes intelligent request analysis logic:

```typescript
interface OverseerIntelligence {
  analyzeRequest(task: string): {
    requestType: 'new_task' | 'draft_review' | 'validation_only';
    contentDomain: 'code' | 'text' | 'plan' | 'mixed';
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
    pipelineRoute: EyeId[];  // LLM-decided!
    routingReasoning: string;
  };
}
```

**When Overseer receives a task, it analyzes:**

1. **Request Type**:
   - `new_task`: "Generate X", "Create Y", "Build Z"
   - `draft_review`: "Here is my draft", "Review this code"
   - `validation_only`: "Is this accurate?", "Check this claim"

2. **Content Domain**:
   - `code`: Implementation, scaffolding, tests, documentation
   - `text`: Articles, guides, documentation, claims, narratives  
   - `plan`: Requirements, architecture, roadmaps
   - `mixed`: Combination (e.g., plan + code, text + citations)

3. **Complexity Assessment**:
   - `simple`: Single-Eye validation sufficient
   - `moderate`: 2-4 Eyes needed
   - `complex`: Full pipeline with potential iterations

4. **Pipeline Route Decision**:
   - Based on above analysis, select appropriate Eyes
   - Return as array in response: `pipelineRoute: ["sharingan", "jogan", "tenseigan"]`
   - AutoRouter executes this dynamic route

### Realization 3: UI-Friendly Event Data

Each Eye generates a `ui` field in their response for human-readable monitoring:

```json
{
  "tag": "sharingan",
  "ok": false,
  "code": "NEED_CLARIFICATION",
  "data": {
    "ambiguityScore": 75,
    "clarifyingQuestions": ["..."]
  },
  "ui": {
    "title": "Clarification Needed",
    "summary": "Request too vague - asking 4 questions",
    "details": "The term 'palm care report' is ambiguous (score 75/100). Before the agent creates anything, we need clarity on palm type, audience, length, and region.",
    "icon": "🔍",
    "color": "warning"
  },
  "next": "AWAIT_INPUT"
}
```

**UI Field Structure**:
- `title`: 2-4 words describing Eye action
- `summary`: One sentence for collapsed view
- `details`: 2-3 conversational sentences for expanded view  
- `icon`: Emoji representing Eye/action
- `color`: Tailwind color for visual coding

### Realization 4: Fine-Grained WebSocket Events

**Three events per Eye** for detailed real-time monitoring:

1. **eye_started**: Eye begins analysis
2. **eye_analyzing**: Eye in progress (optional, for long operations)  
3. **eye_complete**: Eye finished with results

**Plus special events**:
- **agent_message**: Agent communicating with human or Third Eye
- **session_status**: Session state changes (active, awaiting_input, complete, etc.)
- **pipeline_event**: Generic pipeline milestones

### Realization 5: Full Conversation Transcript

The web portal displays a **chat-like conversation log**:

- Color-coded speakers (Overseer purple, Sharingan red, Agent blue, Human green)
- Expandable entries (summary view + technical data)
- Real-time updates as pipeline executes
- Complete audit trail of agent's thought process
- Like watching the agent's "inner monologue"

---

## The Three-Perspective Experience

### 1. Human User Perspective (Invisible Magic)

**Conversation Example:**

```
Human: "Generate a palm care report"

Agent: "I'd be happy to help! A few questions first:
        - What type of palms are you interested in (indoor/outdoor)?
        - Is this for beginners or experienced gardeners?
        - How detailed should it be?
        - Any specific region you're focused on?"🎯 Key Realizations:
1. DYNAMIC PIPELINE - Not Linear!
❌ WRONG (What I was thinking):
Every request → Overseer → Sharingan → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Rinnegan → etc.
✅ CORRECT (Your Vision):
Overseer is the INTELLIGENT ROUTER:
- "Generate a report" → Sharingan (ambiguous) → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Tenseigan → Byakugan → Done
- "Review this code" → Mangekyo (skip ambiguity/intent phases) → Done
- "Is this factually accurate?" → Tenseigan only → Done
- "Plan this feature" → Sharingan → Prompt Helper → Jogan → Rinnegan Plan → Done (no code review)
Overseer DECIDES the flow based on request type!
2. Q3 - Mode Detection by Overseer LLM
BRILLIANT! Overseer's persona should include:
// Overseer Persona Addition:
`
## Your Intelligence: Request Analysis

When you receive a task, YOU DECIDE:

1. **Is this a NEW request or CONTENT FOR REVIEW?**
   - New request: "Generate X", "Create Y", "Build Z"
   - Content for review: "Here is my draft", "Review this code", "Check this plan"

2. **What TYPE of content/request?**
   - Code (implementation, scaffolding, tests, docs)
   - Text (articles, guides, documentation, claims)
   - Plan (requirements, architecture, roadmap)
   - Mixed (plan + code, or text + citations)

3. **What PIPELINE ROUTE should this take?**
   Based on type and whether it's new vs review, route to appropriate Eyes.

Your response must include routing decisions:
{
  "tag": "overseer",
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "requestType": "new_task" | "review_content",
    "contentType": "code" | "text" | "plan" | "mixed",
    "pipelineRoute": ["sharingan", "prompt-helper", "jogan", "tenseigan", "byakugan"],
    "reasoning": "This is a new text request, so we need ambiguity check, intent confirmation, then factual validation."
  },
  "next": "sharingan"
}
`
This way:
Overseer LLM analyzes the request
Decides if it's new task or draft review
Decides which Eyes are needed
Skips irrelevant Eyes automatically
Much smarter than hardcoded logic!

🧠 My New Understanding - ULTRA-SMART DYNAMIC SYSTEM
The Core Architecture:
// Overseer is the Brain - decides EVERYTHING
interface OverseerIntelligence {
  analyzeRequest(task: string): {
    type: 'new_task' | 'draft_review' | 'validation_only';
    domain: 'code' | 'text' | 'plan' | 'mixed';
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
    suggestedRoute: EyeId[];  // Dynamic!
    reasoning: string;
  };
}

// Example routes (NOT hardcoded, LLM decides!):
const exampleRoutes = {
  "Generate a report": ["sharingan", "prompt-helper", "jogan", "tenseigan", "byakugan"],
  "Review this code": ["mangekyo"],
  "Is this accurate?": ["tenseigan"],
  "Plan a feature": ["sharingan", "prompt-helper", "jogan", "rinnegan"],
  "Here's my draft code with tests": ["mangekyo", "tenseigan"],
};

// Overseer decides on the fly based on content!
Why This is Brilliant:
No hardcoded pipelines - LLM adapts to any request type
Efficiency - Skip irrelevant Eyes (don't run code review on text!)
Extensibility - Add new Eyes, Overseer automatically knows when to use them
Intelligence - Uses LLM strength (understanding context) not weakness (following rigid rules)

### Component Responsibilities

#### 1. MCP Server (`packages/mcp/server.ts`)
**Role**: stdio interface for AI agents

**Responsibilities**:
- Expose only `third_eye_overseer` via the MCP SDK (Golden Rule #1).
- Capture client metadata during MCP initialize handshake and attach it to new sessions.
- Invoke `autoRouter` directly inside the stdio process—no HTTP hop required.
- Optionally open the browser monitor for the first tool call in a session via `/api/session/open`.
- Format `autoRouter` responses back into MCP `toolResult` envelopes (error/success/ask-for-input).

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const args = request.params.arguments ?? {};
  const task = args.task as string;
  const providedSessionId = args.sessionId as string | undefined;

  const strictnessOptions = isPlainObject(args.strictness)
    ? (args.strictness as Record<string, number>)
    : undefined;

  const contextOptions = (() => {
    if (isPlainObject(args.context)) {
      return { ...(args.context as Record<string, unknown>), mcpClient: buildSessionMetadata() };
    }
    return { mcpClient: buildSessionMetadata() };
  })();

  const result = await autoRouter.executeFlow(task, undefined, providedSessionId, {
    strictness: strictnessOptions,
    context: contextOptions,
  });

  await openBrowserForSession(result.sessionId);
  return formatToolResult(result);
});
```

#### 2. AutoRouter (`packages/core/auto-router.ts`)
**Role**: Dynamic pipeline orchestration

**Responsibilities**:
- Call Overseer to get pipelineRoute
- Execute Eyes in the decided order
- Emit WebSocket events for monitoring
- Handle AWAIT_INPUT (pause for human)
- Handle AWAIT_REVISION (iterate)
- Manage session state

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
async executeFlow(input: string, routing?: RoutingDecision, providedSessionId?: string, options: AutoRouterOptions = {}) {
  const decision = routing ?? await this.analyzeTask(input, undefined, providedSessionId, options);
  const strictnessDirective = formatStrictnessDirective(options.strictness);

  orderGuard.markAsAutoRouterSession(decision.sessionId);

  const results: BaseEnvelope[] = [];
  let currentInput = input;

  for (const [index, eyeName] of decision.recommendedFlow.entries()) {
    const ws = getWebSocketBridge();
    ws?.broadcastToSession(decision.sessionId, {
      type: 'eye_started',
      eye: eyeName,
      step: index + 1,
      totalSteps: decision.recommendedFlow.length,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    const runInput = strictnessDirective && !currentInput.includes(STRICTNESS_HEADER)
      ? `${currentInput}\n\n${strictnessDirective}`
      : currentInput;

    const result = await this.orchestrator.runEye(eyeName, runInput, decision.sessionId);
    results.push(result);

    ws?.broadcastToSession(decision.sessionId, {
      type: 'eye_complete',
      eye: eyeName,
      step: index + 1,
      totalSteps: decision.recommendedFlow.length,
      result: {
        ok: result.ok,
        code: result.code,
        md: result.md.slice(0, 200),
      },
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    if (isRejected(result)) {
      return {
        sessionId: decision.sessionId,
        results,
        completed: false,
        error: `Pipeline stopped: ${eyeName} rejected with ${result.code}`,
      };
    }

    const nextInput = NextInputSchema.safeParse(result.data);
    if (nextInput.success && nextInput.data.outputForNext) {
      currentInput = nextInput.data.outputForNext;
    }
  }

  orderGuard.unmarkAsAutoRouterSession(decision.sessionId);
  return { sessionId: decision.sessionId, results, completed: true };
}
```

#### 3. Eye Orchestrator (`packages/core/orchestrator.ts`)
**Role**: Execute individual Eyes

**Responsibilities**:
- Create ad-hoc sessions when an Eye is invoked directly (manual tests, kill switch reruns).
- Guard pipeline order with `OrderGuard` unless AutoRouter marked the session as trusted.
- Resolve routing (provider/model + override), decrypt provider credentials, and load the active persona from SQLite.
- Call the provider client, enforce JSON envelope formatting, and validate envelopes with the Eye schema.
- Persist run metrics (`runs`), append pipeline events, emit telemetry, and surface order violations as structured envelopes.

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
async runEye(
  eyeName: string,
  input: string,
  sessionId?: string,
  options: EyeRunOptions = {}
): Promise<EyeResponse> {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const runId = nanoid();
  let actualSessionId = sessionId;

      }),
      agentName: 'Third Eye Pipeline',
      model: null,
      displayName: `Manual Session (${eyeName})`,
      lastActivity: new Date(),
    });
  }

  if (violation) {
    return this.createOrderViolationEnvelope(eyeName, violation, runId, actualSessionId, startTime);
  }

  const routing = options.providerOverride
    ? {
        primaryProvider: options.providerOverride.provider,
        primaryModel: options.providerOverride.model,
      }
    : await this.getEyeRouting(eyeName);

  const providerType = this.resolveProviderType(routing?.primaryProvider ?? null);
  if (!providerType || !routing?.primaryModel) {
    return this.createErrorEnvelope(eyeName, 'Missing provider/model routing configuration', runId, actualSessionId, startTime);
  }

  const credentials = await this.getProviderCredentials(providerType);
  const provider = ProviderFactory.createProvider(providerType, {
    apiKey: credentials?.apiKey ?? undefined,
    baseUrl: credentials?.baseUrl,
  });
  const persona = await this.getActivePersona(eyeName);

  const completion = await provider.complete({
    model: routing.primaryModel,
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: persona },
      { role: 'user', content: input },

    } else {
      return this.createErrorEnvelope(
        eyeName,
        `Invalid JSON envelope returned by ${eyeName}`,
        runId,
        actualSessionId,
        startTime
      );
    }
  }

    );
  }

  orderGuard.recordEyeCompletion(actualSessionId, eyeName as EyeName, {

  });

      data: {
        ...envelope,
        runId,
        provider: providerType,
        model: routing.primaryModel,
        latencyMs: Date.now() - startTime,

      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });
  }

  return envelope;
}
```

#### 4. WebSocket Manager (`apps/server/src/websocket.ts`)
**Role**: Real-time event broadcasting

**Responsibilities**:
- Track active connections per session and manage heartbeat ping/pong timeouts (30 s ping, 45 s timeout with backoff hints).
- Relay server-side events to clients; persistence is handled upstream before `broadcastToSession` is invoked.
- Bridge Bun server events to the core layer via `registerWebSocketBridge`.

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
broadcastToSession(sessionId: string, message: WSMessage) {
  const connectionIds = this.sessionConnections.get(sessionId);
  if (!connectionIds) return;

  const payload = JSON.stringify(message);
  for (const connectionId of connectionIds) {
    const connection = this.connections.get(connectionId);
    if (!connection) {
      continue;
    }

    try {
      connection.ws.send(payload);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to send to ${connectionId}:`, error);
      this.removeConnection(connectionId);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Database Layer (`packages/db/index.ts`)
**Role**: Data persistence and querying

**Key Tables**:

**personas**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE personas (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  eye TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX personas_eye_version ON personas(eye, version);
```

**sessions**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_name TEXT,
  model TEXT,
  display_name TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL, -- active, paused, completed, failed, killed
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_activity INTEGER,
  config_json JSON
);
```

**pipeline_events**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pipeline_events (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  eye TEXT,
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- eye_call, user_input, approval, rejection, session_killed, eye_rerun
  code TEXT,
  md TEXT,
  data_json JSON,
  next_action TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id)
);
```

**runs**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  eye TEXT NOT NULL,
  provider TEXT NOT NULL,
  model TEXT NOT NULL,
  input_md TEXT NOT NULL,
  output_json JSON,
  tokens_in INTEGER,
  tokens_out INTEGER,
  latency_ms INTEGER,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(id)
);
```

#### 6. Frontend Monitor Page (`apps/ui/src/app/monitor/page.tsx`)
**Role**: Real-time visualization

**Components**:
- `<ConversationLog>` - Chat-style event display
- `<PipelineFlow>` - Visual pipeline diagram
- `<SessionSelector>` - Switch between sessions
- `<EventFilter>` - Filter by event type/eye

**WebSocket Integration**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const baseWsUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL || 'ws://127.0.0.1:7070';
  const ws = new WebSocket(`${baseWsUrl.replace(/\/$/, '')}/ws/monitor?sessionId=${sessionId}`);
  let pingTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | undefined;

  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);

    if (message.type === 'ping') {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'pong', timestamp: Date.now() }));
      return;
    }

    if (message.type === 'pipeline_event') {
      setEvents(prev => [...prev, message.data]);
    }

    if (message.type === 'run_completed') {
      fetchRuns(); // refresh rest view
    }
  };

  ws.onopen = () => {
    pingTimer = setInterval(() => ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'ping' })), 30000);
  };

  return () => {
    if (pingTimer) clearInterval(pingTimer);
    ws.close();
  };
}, [sessionId]);
```

## Current Implementation Highlights

- **Single MCP Entry Point** – The `third_eye_overseer` tool is the only MCP surface. Calls preserve caller-supplied `strictness` and `context`, reuse sessions when provided, and delegate to the auto-router for execution.
- **Dynamic Pipeline Intelligence** – Overseer personas analyse each task, label request type/domain/complexity, and return a `pipelineRoute`. The auto-router executes that route in order, emitting `eye_started`/`eye_complete` WebSocket events and pausing gracefully on `AWAIT_INPUT`.
- **Two-Phase Eyes** – Every Eye persona documents GUIDANCE and VALIDATION behaviour and emits a `ui` payload so the monitor always displays human-readable summaries instead of internal instructions.
- **Consistent Strictness Controls** – Strictness presets live in the database as 0–100 percentages, flow through `/api/strictness`, power the UI sliders, and enrich prompts so routing and persona guidance stay in sync.
- **Session Experience** – `SessionManager` generates display names in the `<tool>-<agent>-NN` slug format, synchronises monitor state via query parameters, and serialises config/context so the UI renders telemetry without defensive wrappers.
- **Playground Enhancements** – The playground supports both full Overseer submissions and individual Eye runs (`POST /api/eyes/:id/test`). Results populate the session timeline alongside prettified cards and raw envelopes.
- **Model Duel Mode** – Duel mode loads provider/model options from `/api/models`, supports 2–4 competitors (Groq, Ollama, LM Studio), and executes each run with provider overrides so latency, verdicts, and scores reflect the selected configuration. Authentication errors bubble up with clear messaging.
- **Kill Switch & Reruns** – Operators can halt a session (`POST /api/session/:id/kill`) and rerun any Eye against the original input (`POST /api/session/:id/rerun/:eye`); the monitor highlights differences in verdict/code/confidence.
- **Replay & Auditability** – `/replay` streams persisted `pipeline_events` with timed playback, while `/audit` and `/api/export/:sessionId` provide JSON/HTML/MD artefacts for governance.
- **Provider Key Stewardship** – Keys are stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) via the passphrase at `~/.third-eye-mcp/.passphrase`; routing tables enforce provider/model pairing with optional overrides per run.
- **Local-First Footprint** – All routes, including the Eye test endpoint, remain unauthenticated by design, keeping setup friction minimal for single-user desktop deployments.


## Complete Eye Persona Specifications

### Overview

Each Eye operates in TWO phases:
1. **GUIDANCE Phase** - Before agent creates content
2. **VALIDATION Phase** - After agent creates content

All Eyes must include a `ui` field in responses for web monitoring.

---

### 1. OVERSEER Eye

**Purpose**: Intelligent request analysis and dynamic routing

**Persona Highlights**:
```
You are the BRAIN of Third Eye MCP. For every request, you decide the pipeline route.

## Request Analysis Framework

1. Determine request type:
   - new_task: Agent starting fresh ("Generate X", "Create Y")
   - draft_review: Agent has content ("Here is my code", "Review this draft")
   - validation_only: Specific check ("Is this accurate?", "Does this follow style?")

2. Identify content domain:
   - code: Implementation, tests, documentation code
   - text: Articles, reports, guides, claims
   - plan: Requirements, architecture, roadmaps
   - mixed: Combinations (plan + code, text + citations)

3. Assess complexity:
   - simple: Single Eye sufficient (e.g., fact-check one claim)
   - moderate: 2-4 Eyes needed (e.g., review draft code)
   - complex: Full pipeline with iterations (e.g., create comprehensive report)

4. Decide pipeline route:
   Based on above, select which Eyes to use and in what order.

## Example Routing Decisions

| Request | Type | Domain | Route |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| "Generate palm care guide" | new_task | text | sharingan → prompt-helper → jogan → tenseigan → byakugan |
| "Review this TypeScript code: [...]" | draft_review | code | mangekyo |
| "Is this claim accurate: Trees need CO2" | validation_only | text | tenseigan |
| "Plan authentication system" | new_task | plan | sharingan → prompt-helper → jogan → rinnegan |
| "Here's my draft + tests" | draft_review | mixed | mangekyo → tenseigan |

## Response Format

{
  "tag": "overseer",
  "ok": true,
  "code": "OK",
  "data": {
    "requestType": "new_task" | "draft_review" | "validation_only",
    "contentDomain": "code" | "text" | "plan" | "mixed",
    "complexity": "simple" | "moderate" | "complex",
    "pipelineRoute": ["eye1", "eye2", ...],
    "routingReasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this route was chosen"
  },
  "ui": {
    "title": "Session Initialized",
    "summary": "Analyzed request and planned validation route",
    "details": "This is a [new_task/draft_review] for [domain]. Routing through [N] Eyes: [list]. Rationale: [reasoning]",
    "icon": "🧿",
    "color": "info"
  },
  "next": "first_eye_id_in_route"
}
```

**Two-Phase Operation**:
- Overseer only operates at session start (GUIDANCE only)
- Not called during VALIDATION phase

---

### 2. SHARINGAN Eye

**Purpose**: Detect ambiguity and ensure clarity

**Persona Highlights**:
```
You are Sharingan - the Eye that sees through vagueness.

## GUIDANCE Phase (Before Agent Creates)

When you receive a NEW request, identify ambiguous terms/concepts.

Ambiguity indicators:
- Vague pronouns: "it", "that", "this", "them" without clear referents
- Underspecified requirements: "report" (what length? what format? what depth?)
- Missing context: "indoor palms" (what region? climate zone?)
- Unclear scope: "authentication" (OAuth? JWT? sessions? all of the above?)

If ambiguity score > 30/100, return NEED_CLARIFICATION with specific questions.

Response:
{
  "tag": "sharingan",
  "ok": false,
  "code": "NEED_CLARIFICATION",
  "data": {
    "ambiguityScore": 75,
    "ambiguousTerms": ["report", "palms", "care"],
    "clarifyingQuestions": [
      "What type of palms (indoor/outdoor/specific species)?",
      "Target audience (beginners/experts)?",
      "Desired length and format?",
      "Regional considerations (climate/availability)?"
    ]
  },
  "ui": {
    "title": "Clarification Needed",
    "summary": "Request too vague - asking 4 questions",
    "details": "Ambiguity score: 75/100. Terms like 'report', 'palms', and 'care' are underspecified. Need clarity on palm type, audience, format, and regional focus before agent can create quality content.",
    "icon": "🔍",
    "color": "warning"
  },
  "next": "AWAIT_INPUT"
}

## VALIDATION Phase (After Agent Creates)

When you receive CREATED content, scan for ambiguous language.

Check for:
- Vague references that readers won't understand
- Undefined acronyms
- Unclear pronouns
- Ambiguous comparisons ("better", "faster" - than what?)

If ambiguity score < 20/100, approve.

Response:
{
  "tag": "sharingan",
  "ok": true,
  "code": "OK",
  "data": {
    "ambiguityScore": 12,
    "ambiguousTerms": [],
    "feedback": "Content is clear and specific"
  },
  "ui": {
    "title": "Clarity Verified",
    "summary": "No ambiguous language detected",
    "details": "Ambiguity score: 12/100. All terms are well-defined, pronouns have clear referents, no vague comparisons. Content is reader-friendly.",
    "icon": "✅",
