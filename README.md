Third Eye MCP is a Bun-powered Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that coordinates eight specialised "Eyes" across Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, and LM Studio providers. It delivers intelligent routing with automatic fallbacks, persona versioning, strict envelope validation, and a real-time monitoring dashboard—while keeping all data on your machine.

## Quick Start

> **Requirement:** Bun 1.0+ must be installed. Verify with `bun --version`.

```bash
# Launch without installing globally
bunx third-eye-mcp up

# MCP server → http://127.0.0.1:7070
# Dashboard  → http://127.0.0.1:3300
```

What happens on first run:
- Seeds SQLite database at `~/.third-eye-mcp/mcp.db`
- Activates all eight Eyes with default personas
- Starts Next.js dashboard with live pipeline telemetry
- Preloads intelligent routing and fallback chains

Need the CLI on your PATH? Install globally after Bun is installed:

```bash
npm install -g third-eye-mcp           # or pnpm add -g / bun add -g
third-eye-mcp up
```

---

## Installation Options

- **Zero-install (recommended)** – `bunx third-eye-mcp up`
- **Global CLI** – `npm install -g third-eye-mcp` then run `third-eye-mcp up`
- **From source**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/HishamBS/third-eye-mcp.git
  cd third-eye-mcp
  bun install
  bun run build:packages
  bun run db:migrate
  bun run dev
  ```

Hardware & accounts:
- Groq and/or OpenRouter API keys (or local Ollama / LM Studio)
- Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue.dev, or Warp for MCP client integration

---

## Core Workflow

1. **Start services** – `bunx third-eye-mcp up`
2. **Open dashboard** – [http://127.0.0.1:3300](http://127.0.0.1:3300)
3. **Configure providers** – Settings → Providers (Groq/OpenRouter keys) or local runtimes
4. **Adjust routing** – Models & Routing tab (primary + fallback models per Eye)
5. **Connect your MCP client** – follow [docs/integrations](docs/integrations/README.md)
6. **Monitor sessions** – live pipeline telemetry, persona versioning, replay history

For end-to-end usage scenarios, see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Development

```bash
bun install                # install workspace dependencies
bun run build              # build packages, server, UI, CLI (alias for release pipeline)

pnpm lint                  # type-check monorepo
pnpm test:coverage         # run Vitest with coverage
pnpm test:e2e              # Playwright end-to-end tests

third-eye-mcp reset        # wipe ~/.third-eye-mcp (destructive)
third-eye-mcp logs --tail  # follow combined logs
```

Key scripts:
- `bun run health:full` – comprehensive diagnostics
- `bun run ws:check` – WebSocket reconnect simulation
- `bun run scripts/seed-database.ts` – reseed personas/routing

---

## Release & Publishing

Third Eye MCP ships to npm as `third-eye-mcp`. For an end-to-end automated release (version prompt → gates → publish → tag), run:

```bash
bunx third-eye-mcp release:ship
```

Prefer manual control? Follow the publishing checklist in [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md):

```bash
pnpm release:prepare       # clean → lint → test → build → pack
pnpm release:prepare:dry   # add npm publish --dry-run
npm publish --access public
```

Before publishing:
- Ensure `dist/cli.js` and `dist/mcp-server.js` are rebuilt with `bun run build:cli`
- Update version and changelog via `bunx third-eye-mcp release` or manual edits
- Verify archive artefact (`third-eye-mcp-<version>.tgz`) and generated docs
